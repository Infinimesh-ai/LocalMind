# Track: Context Memory

## Intent

Make Rule, Automatic Memory, rolling conversation summaries, and cross-session
recall scope-correct, permission-aware, trust-separated, and auditable before
adding more sophisticated extraction or retrieval.

## Implemented Foundation

LocalMind already persists private user-owned context records with user,
workspace, document, or project scope. Users can manage these records and the
Automatic Memory preference under **Workspace settings > AI context**.

The `context-planner/v5` slice adds the first production hardening layer:

- a single scope resolver combines the conversation's primary document with
  documents attached through AI Context;
- every candidate document is rechecked with `Doc.Read` before it can affect
  document or project memory visibility;
- active project membership is derived only from those readable documents;
- project context is enabled only when every readable document resolves to the
  same single active project;
- mixed, multi-project, and otherwise ambiguous document sets load no project
  memory;
- Automatic Memory writes to one unique project, one readable document, or the
  workspace only when no document is in scope;
- Automatic Memory capture is skipped when multiple readable documents do not
  resolve to one project, instead of copying into multiple projects or widening
  the record to workspace scope;
- the same resolved scope snapshot is used for recall and capture in a turn.

Planner v5 renders Rule, Automatic Memory, project summaries, and rolling
conversation summaries as a bounded synthetic `user` message immediately before
the latest user turn. This context is explicitly labeled untrusted and is no
longer coalesced into the primary system message. The immutable v1-v4 strategy
versions and fingerprints remain available for replay.

Every planned text turn now appends an `ai_context_plan_traces` record when the
session saves. A trace contains:

- strategy version and fingerprint;
- input, retained, omitted, candidate, and selected counts;
- selected memory ids, scope/kind, score, and rank;
- context character budget and usage;
- resolved document/project scope evidence;
- input and rendered-output fingerprints.

The trace intentionally excludes message, Rule, Memory, project summary, and
rolling summary text. AI Context strategy diagnostics expose aggregate trace
count and latest trace time without exposing per-turn private context.

The `context-planner/v6` slice builds the commercial-memory foundation on that
trust and scope boundary:

- the Memory Writer produces explicit `ADD`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `NOOP`
  decisions, with deterministic handling for direct remember/forget requests;
- memory rows carry fact keys, confidence, importance, validity and expiry,
  sensitivity, supersession, embedding, use count, and last-used evidence;
- each owner/scope retains at most 200 active Automatic Memory rows, evicting
  the least recently used rows when a write would exceed the quota;
- a disabled memory can be reactivated without violating the active-fact
  uniqueness contract or leaving conflicting active versions;
- authorized candidates are ranked with keyword and embedding similarity,
  temporal/confidence features, reranking, and MMR diversity;
- Rule is modeled independently with `always`, `relevant`, and `manual`
  application modes, priorities, conditions, immutable revisions, rollback,
  and hit records;
- workspace-enforced Policy is a separate layer from private user Rule and
  Automatic Memory;
- ambiguous document sets support an explicit project selection that is
  validated against the readable resolved scope;
- users can inspect, edit, disable, delete, undo, revise, and roll back the
  relevant context records from **Workspace settings > AI context**;
- the v6 evaluation smoke records extraction, DLP, retrieval, scope leakage,
  Rule interference, conflict priority, and latency metrics.

## Scope Contract

| Readable context                          | Project result | Recall/capture behavior                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No document                               | `none`         | User Rule plus workspace memory; new Automatic Memory may use workspace scope                     |
| One unassigned document                   | `none`         | User Rule, workspace memory, and that document's memory; new Automatic Memory uses document scope |
| One or more documents, all in one project | `single`       | User, workspace, document, and that one project scope; new Automatic Memory uses project scope    |
| Project and unassigned documents mixed    | `mixed`        | No project memory; multi-document Automatic Memory capture is skipped                             |
| Documents span multiple projects          | `ambiguous`    | No project memory; multi-document Automatic Memory capture is skipped                             |
| Document fails `Doc.Read`                 | excluded       | It cannot contribute document/project recall or capture scope                                     |

Without an explicit project selection, ambiguous cases still fail closed.
Selections are accepted only when the project is represented by the current
readable document set; an invalid or stale selection cannot widen visibility.

## Current Limits

The v6 foundation still has follow-up work before broad production rollout:

- implicit Automatic Memory extraction remains heuristic when no configured
  structured model extractor is available;
- DLP is intentionally fail-closed for known sensitive forms but is not a full
  enterprise classifier;
- local deterministic embeddings and reranking provide a stable fallback, but
  production Sparkclaw embedding/reranker quality and cost still require online
  evaluation;
- rolling summaries are heuristic rather than model-generated structured
  summaries;
- traces support replay diagnostics but do not yet join answer-quality,
  user-feedback, and online experiment outcomes;
- scheduled expiry cleanup and large-corpus query performance still need
  production load validation beyond the write-time per-scope LRU quota.

## Next Vertical Slices

1. Replace heuristic implicit extraction with a configured structured model
   extractor while preserving the deterministic explicit-command path.
2. Add scheduled lifecycle cleanup and production-scale retrieval/load
   benchmarks around the existing per-owner/scope quota.
3. Connect Sparkclaw embedding/reranker providers behind the existing hybrid
   retrieval interfaces and add shadow evaluation before rollout.
4. Join planner traces with explicit user correction/undo and answer-quality
   outcomes without persisting sensitive prompt content.
5. Add model-generated structured rolling summaries with provenance and
   conflict-safe refresh.
6. Add strategy shadowing, staged rollout, and online A/B controls after offline
   baselines are representative and benchmark-specific production rules are
   prohibited.

Do not introduce a knowledge graph before fact keys, temporal versioning, and
the evaluation suite show that multi-entity or multi-hop relations require it.

## Validation

The inbound MCP surface no longer exposes direct AI Context tools. A future
LocalMind AI Context executor must use this track's DLP, scope authorization,
revision, rollback, and undo behavior instead of creating a parallel mutation
path.

The focused contract must cover:

- an attached project document resolving project memory outside a
  document-bound chat;
- revoked document permission excluding that document and its project;
- mixed and multi-project inputs loading no project memory;
- ambiguous multi-document inputs producing no Automatic Memory write unless a
  valid explicit project is selected;
- Planner v5 placing private context in `user`, not primary `system`;
- v4 replay preserving the previous system-context behavior and fingerprint;
- v6 fact-key conflict updates, expiry, supersession, reactivation, and undo;
- v6 Rule/Policy application modes, condition matching, priority, revisions,
  rollback, and hit traces;
- v6 authorized hybrid retrieval, MMR diversity, and scope leakage of zero;
- plan traces containing ids, scores, budgets, scope, and fingerprints without
  private context text;
- native-renderer baselines using natural durable cues for short retention,
  early/recent fact retention, rolling-summary creation, and cross-session
  recall under tight budgets.

Run the isolated Copilot typecheck, GraphQL generation, format/lint checks,
host scope/v6 smokes, Docker-focused Copilot tests, native v6/v5/v4 baselines,
and a disposable PostgreSQL migration check for changes to this track.
